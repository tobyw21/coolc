## COOL (Classroom Object Oriented Language) 
COOL is a language designed in
1996 by Alexander Aiken, Standford University. The original `coolc` is written in `C/C++` and generates file on MIP32 platform. The project starter code is from Standford
University cs143 - Compilers, and my project plan is to make a `coolc`
compile COOL into x86-64 instruction set and maybe rewrite `coolc` in `Rust` in
the future.

Note that I deleted `Java` version of source and will be implement in `C++`.
